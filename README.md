# Bixlabs Kotlin Styleguide

This page contains the current coding style for the Kotlin language.

## Naming Style

If in doubt, default to the Java Coding Conventions such as:

* use of camelCase for names (and avoid underscore in names)
* types start with upper case
* methods and properties start with lower case
* use 4 space indentation
* public functions should have documentation such that it appears in Kotlin Doc

## Colon

There is a space before colon where colon separates type and supertype and there's no space where colon separates instance and type:

```kotlin
interface Foo<out T : Any> : Bar {
    fun foo(a: Int): T
}
```

## Lambdas

In lambda expressions, spaces should be used around the curly braces, as well as around the arrow which separates the parameters from the body. Whenever possible, a lambda should be passed outside of parentheses.

```kotlin
list.filter { it > 10 }.map { element -> element * 2 }
```

In lambdas which are short and not nested, it's recommended to use the it convention instead of declaring the parameter explicitly. In nested lambdas with parameters, parameters should be always declared explicitly.

## Class header formatting

Classes with a few arguments can be written in a single line:

class Person(id: Int, name: String)
Classes with longer headers should be formatted so that each primary constructor argument is in a separate line with indentation. Also, the closing parenthesis should be on a new line. If we use inheritance, then the superclass constructor call or list of implemented interfaces should be located on the same line as the parenthesis:

```kotlin
class Person(
    id: Int, 
    name: String,
    surname: String
) : Human(id, name) {
    // ...
}
```

For multiple interfaces, the superclass constructor call should be located first and then each interface should be located in a different line:

```kotlin
class Person(
    id: Int, 
    name: String,
    surname: String
) : Human(id, name),
    KotlinMaker {
    // ...
}
```

Constructor parameters can use either the regular indent or the continuation indent (double the regular indent).

## Unit

If a function returns Unit, the return type should be omitted:

```kotlin
fun foo() { // ": Unit" is omitted here

}
```

## Functions vs Properties

In some cases functions with no arguments might be interchangeable with read-only properties. Although the semantics are similar, there are some stylistic conventions on when to prefer one to another.

Prefer a property over a function when the underlying algorithm:

* does not throw any Exceptions
* has a `O(1)` complexity
* is cheap to calculate (or ca—Åhed on the first run)
* returns the same result over invocations

## apply

Use `apply` for initialization:

```kotlin
val foo = createBar().apply {
    property = value
    init()
}
```

## also

Use `also` over `apply` if the receiver is used for anything other than setting properties or function calls on it:

```kotlin
class Baz {
    var currentBar: Bar?
    val observable: Observable

    val foo = createBar().also {
        currentBar = it
        observable.registerCallback(it)
    }
}
```

Prefer `also` over `apply` if there already are multiple receivers in scope, especially if you make calls on any outer receivers:

```kotlin
class Foo {
    fun Bar.baz() {
        val stuff = callSomething().also {
            it.init()
            this@baz.registerCallback(it)
        }
    }
}
```

example: Using also for a "singleton with parameter" (from Google's architecture components sample code):

```kotlin
class UsersDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

    companion object {

        @Volatile private var INSTANCE: UsersDatabase? = null

        fun getInstance(context: Context): UsersDatabase =
                INSTANCE ?: synchronized(this) {
                    INSTANCE ?: buildDatabase(context).also { INSTANCE = it }
                }

        private fun buildDatabase(context: Context) =
                Room.databaseBuilder(context.applicationContext,
                        UsersDatabase::class.java, "Sample.db")
                        .build()
    }
}
```

## apply/with/run

Prefer `apply/run` over `with` if the receiver is nullable.

```kotlin
getNullable()?.run {
    init()
}

getNullable()?.apply {
    init()
}
```

Prefer `run/with` over apply if the returned value is not used

```koltin
view.run {
    textView.text = "Hello World"
    progressBar.init()
}

with(view) {
    textView.text = "Hello World"
    progressBar.init()
}
```

Choose one of the above and use it consistently.

## let

Prefer `let` over `run` in method chains that transform the receiver

```kotlin
val baz: Baz = foo.let { createBar(it) }.convertBarToBaz()
// or with function references
val baz: Baz = foo.let(::createBar).convertBarToBaz()
```
